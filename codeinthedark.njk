  <h1>Code in the Dark, 15.2.2024</h1>

  <p>
    We are organizing a
    <a href="http://codeinthedark.com/">Code in the Dark</a> event on Thursday,
    February 15th 2024 17-20.30 and you're invited to join!
  </p>

  <h2>What's Code in the Dark?</h2>

  <p>
    Code in the Dark is a fun programming competition where teams of developers
    aim to replicate given screenshots with just HTML, CSS and assets within a
    short time frame - with a twist.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes this event so unique is that during the development of the
    challenges, developers cannot preview their output. They are,
    <em>in the dark</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each round lasts 15 minutes and at the end of it, the audience gets to vote
    which team managed to do the best job. We have a round of applauds, maybe a
    few laughs at the unintentional tiny mistakes that completely wreck the
    layout and then we move on to the next round.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developers' screens are mirrored so that the audience sees everything the
    developers are writing in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Code in the Dark is technically a competition, it's not that serious.
  </p>
